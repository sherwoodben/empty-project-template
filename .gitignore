# default project .gitignore file

# ignore the build directory:
/build

# ignore any build directories which might be located in the vendor directory (i.e. for libraries we need to build as part of the project):
/vendors/*/build

# ignore the (generated) documentation files:
/docs

# ignore the .vs folder inside the premake directory, as well as the solution that is generated by the batch file:
/premake/.vs
*.sln

# ignore any executables that we've somehow included:
*.exe

# ignore the tests header (if it's even there) since we sourced that from its own repository:
/tests/include

# ignore the GENERATED autoversion.h file since it depends on git tags/commit hashes and could lead to confusing history. The file which is
# is used to actually generate the header is tracked, so this is fine.
/src/autoversion.h

# ADD files and folders as needed
