//
// If we are building an application (console or window), this serves as the (default) entry point to our program.
//
// Typically, libraries _do not_ have main functions, but in some cases they might! By default, libraries _will not_
// implement this main function. However, this behavior can be changed by editing this (default) file, or more
// specifically by uncommenting the following line:

// #undef bNO_ENTRY_POINT

// if we're building tests, the "bUnitTests.h" header already has a main function to use as the (test) application's
// entry point so we don't need to include another entry point. This even overrides the value set above!
//
// the 'bBUILD_TESTS' value is a unit testing application preprocessor definition, which should be defined by the
// testing application/through use of the configuration script-- if it's not defined then tests are not built!
