# empty-project-template
A starting point for a C++ project. Simply place the premake5.exe in "/premake/" subdirectory (or just add premake to your system path) and make use of the provided batch files!

To utilize the custom premake configuration script, be sure to run premake with the  "--configure" option (or use the provided batch file). This will create a file "config.json" which will be used when the actual build/make command is issued with premake.

The "--clean" option has also been fleshed out in the provided "premake.lua" file; it will delete any of the files generated by Visual Studio in the "/premake/" directory as well as any (top level) "/build/" directory (i.e. build directories in other subdirectories such as "vendors/XYZ/build/" are NOT removed). It will NOT remove the "config.json" file, if that has been generated already.

## known issues
If wildcard matching is used in the library include directories, it seems premake/Visual Studio might get confused and cannot actually locate the directories to include. This means each individual directory must be provided rather than using wildcard matching to match all include directories. Slightly inconvenient, but not the end of the world.

The "configuration script" isn't 100% foolproof. It might be required to do some manual editing of the "premake5.lua" file in certain circumstances. The "config.json" file may be easier to edit by hand as well, once the expected inputs are understood.

Better documentation for the setup/configuration of a project using this template is expected to be provided eventually. However, the ideas presented in this README and the comments in the "premake5.lua" file _should_ be enough to provide a user with what they need to know to hack something together.
